//    MARK: -WELCOME-
case onboard1 = "Fire Journal is a daily tracking, accountability, and fire station management solution for fire officers. It’s easy to use. Check out this brief overview and welcome aboard!"
//    MARK: -SUPPORT-
case onboard2 = "Getting answers at any time of day or night is very important. There are multiple types of assistance available to you, including FAQs and FREE online 24/7 support. If you need help, creating a service request is fast and easy. You may register at the end of this introduction."
//    MARK: -SETTINGS-
case onboard3 = "The first thing you should do is create a profile for yourself. Once you complete a profile, many of your actions will include pre-filled in data based on your profile. You will set up your profile in Settings. When you transfer from one assignment to another, you can always update your profile."
//    MARK: -CUSTOMIZING-
case onboard4 = "Fire Journal includes a standard set of data that may or may not be applicable to your fire department. Customizing is easy. Go into the Fire Journal Settings section. Tap on any option and add the data that you may need. Configure your platoons, fire apparatus, ranks, tags, local incident types, and much more. Don’t need some of the included data? Delete it. Make it perfect for you and your department."
//    MARK: -MAPS-
case onboard5 = "The maps function in Fire Journal is one of the most useful tools you can have. You can create a historical map of every activity you perform in the field. Track your fires, EMS, and rescue runs. If you perform community risk reduction visits, every home you visit is listed. Over time, you’ll see patterns emerge, and that may help you manage your crew, apparatus, and fire prevention activities."
//    MARK: -FORMS-
case onboard6 = "Fire Journal is designed to make completing essential forms fast and easy. Use your keyboard, an Apple pencil, or even your voice to enter data into a form. Some forms are designed for campaigns, such as canvassing a neighborhood as a component of community risk reduction. Additional forms will be added in an ongoing manner. Each form may be attached to an incident, if appropriate."
//    MARK: -JOURNAL-
case onboard8 = "Say goodbye to paper journals. Fire Journal provides you with a powerful method of tracking all of the daily activities that take place in your fire station. From morning line-up to fire prevention to shopping, union issues, or anything you would ordinarily write into a journal. Remember, you may use the built-in mic to record each entry - no typing required."
//    MARK: -MEMBERSHIP-
case onboard9 = "Subscribe to a Membership in Fire Journal. Get reports on your calls for service, export forms in the appropriate format, view historical charts, additional journaling and incident entry tools, and much more. Membership also provides auto-sync between devices. Once you’re a Fire Journal member, you can work not only on your iOS device, but in any Windows or Mac browser as well."
//    MARK: -QUESTIONS-
case onboard10 = "If you have questions, or need assistance, use the Support option in the menu.

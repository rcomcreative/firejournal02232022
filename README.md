## About Fire Journal

Fire Journal is for firefighters and fire officers alike. It’s faster than a pencil. It’s easy to use. It’s for smart devices, including  the Apple iPhone and iPad. It’s unlike anything else.

Use Fire Journal to manage the essential activities that make up a daily tour in a fire station. Record starting your shift and note who you relieved. Track your morning staff or lineup meetings. Record those things you currently write down in a logbook.
